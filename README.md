## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but also creates new ones. Don't blindly chase "progress" without considering what you're leaving behind. Who benefits most from the change, and who suffers? Always ask those questions, because the future isn't just about faster and shinier, it's about who gets to use it, and at what cost. If the cost outweighs the benefit for a large part of the population, then rethink the progress.
