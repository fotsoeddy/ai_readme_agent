## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones. Don't be naive and think innovation is purely beneficial. Every advancement demands we adapt and learn, or we become victims of our own creations. Always ask, "What are the unintended consequences?" before you embrace the shiny new thing.

- Evelyn Reed"
