## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances, yes, but it also requires constant maintenance. Don't assume your new system will run itself. Regular audits and security updates are mandatory, not optional. Neglect this, and you're just creating a bigger problem for the future. And never underestimate the need for user training.
- Eleanor Vance"
