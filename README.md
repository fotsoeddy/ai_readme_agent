## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but it only delivers what you program it to. Don't be fooled by the speed; slow down and check the output. Every system, no matter how advanced, is still subject to garbage in, garbage out. Remember that progress is not inevitable, but rather a consequence of deliberate choices. If you automate a broken process, you simply accelerate the chaos.
- Ada Lovelace II"
