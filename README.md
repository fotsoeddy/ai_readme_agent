## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote, fitting your description:

Technology simplifies tasks. That's its promise.
But simplification without understanding creates dependence.
Dependence without critical thought breeds vulnerability.
Use new tools, but always understand their core functions.
Don't let progress become a shortcut to incompetence.
- Evelyn Reed"
