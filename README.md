## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't wait for permission.
It shows up and reshapes the world whether you're ready or not.
The question isn't whether it's good or bad, but what you do with it.
Ignoring it is not a solution; understanding it is.
Figure out how to use it to build, not just to consume.

- Eleanor Vance"
