## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology moves fast, but it only solves problems humans define.
New tools amplify existing tendencies, good or bad.
Progress isn't automatic; it requires critical thinking, not just adoption.
Don't mistake novelty for improvement. Focus on real-world impact.
Always ask: who benefits and at what cost?

- Evelyn Hayes, Systems Analyst"
