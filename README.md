## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances, but human nature doesn't.
Every new tool is a double-edged sword, promising efficiency and demanding adaptation.
Forget the hype. Ask who benefits and who gets left behind.
Progress without purpose is just faster chaos.
Learn to use it, but don't let it use you.

- Evelyn Reed"
