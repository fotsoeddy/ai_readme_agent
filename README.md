## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should be a tool, not a crutch.
It solves some problems, but creates others we didn't anticipate.
Constant upgrades don't equal constant improvement, often it's just planned obsolescence.
Remember to focus on fixing actual issues people face, not just inventing the next shiny thing.
Measure progress by the betterment of lives, not the growth of market share.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
