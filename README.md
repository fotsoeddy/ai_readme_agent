## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promised ease, but ease requires choices.
Every new tool shifts the power dynamics;
Understand who benefits before celebrating "progress".
Uncritical adoption isn't advancement, it's outsourcing responsibility.
Think before you click, or someone else will think for you.
- Eleanor Vance"
