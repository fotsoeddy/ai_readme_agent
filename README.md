## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool. Like a hammer, it can build a house or smash a skull.
Progress isn't about how fancy the tool is, but what we choose to create with it.
Focus less on the next shiny object and more on the problems worth solving.
If your innovation doesn't improve lives, it's just a distraction.
Always ask: Who benefits, and at what cost?"
- Evelyn Reed"
