## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a solution.
Faster doesn't always mean better; think before you automate.
Progress isn't about inventing new things, but improving existing ones.
Don't let the shiny distractions blind you to real problems.
Always ask: who benefits, and at what cost?

- Evelyn Reed"
