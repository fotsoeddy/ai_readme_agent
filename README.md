## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's just a tool. It doesn't solve problems on its own.
Garbage in, garbage out, still applies, even faster now.
Focus on what you *want* to achieve, not just the newest gadget.
Innovation is wasted if nobody can actually use the result.
Don't be so blinded by progress that you forget common sense.

- Elias Thorne"
