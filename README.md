## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it always creates new ones.
Ignore the underlying impact at your peril.
Progress isn't about speed; it's about direction.
Always ask: are we building a better *world* or just a faster one?
Ultimately, if it doesn't improve lives, it's just a toy.
- Eleanor Vance"
