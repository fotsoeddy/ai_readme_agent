## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's amplified effort.
It automates, connects, and calculates faster than we can.
But garbage in, garbage out still applies, and ethics matter.
Progress is measured by how many lives we genuinely improve,
not just the number of new features or stock price increases.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Engineer"
