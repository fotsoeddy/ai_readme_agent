## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology only solves problems it's designed to solve.
It rarely addresses root causes, often masking them instead.
Don't mistake efficiency for true advancement; consider the cost.
Progress isn't just faster; it's better, safer, and more inclusive.
Always ask: Who benefits? And at whose expense?

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
