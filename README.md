## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It's a tool.

The speed of progress doesn't automatically mean progress. Think about what you're building.

If a solution creates more problems than it solves, it's not a solution. It's a mess with new marketing.

Don't get so caught up in *how* you do something that you forget to ask *why*.

Innovation is about making things better, not just making them different.

- Grace Hopper Turing"
