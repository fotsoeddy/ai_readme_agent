## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but delivers choices. More choices require more knowledge, and that takes time and resources. Don't assume progress means simplicity. It often means trading one set of problems for another, hopefully better, set. Always ask: who benefits, and at what cost?
- Elara Vance"
