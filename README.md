## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances. That's unavoidable. But progress? That's a choice we make. Make sure the new tools benefit everyone, not just a few. Don't confuse faster with better. And always ask, 'What problem are we actually solving?' before building the next shiny thing."
- Anya Sharma"
