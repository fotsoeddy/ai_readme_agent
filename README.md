## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not magic. Every advancement comes with a cost, even if itâ€™s just the old way fading away. Question the convenience; understand the consequences. Progress should serve humanity, not replace it. Innovation isn't inherently good, responsible use is.
- Elias Thorne"
