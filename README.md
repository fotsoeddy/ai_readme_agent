## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't about ease; it's about access.
Progress shouldn't widen the gap, but bridge it.
If a tool needs constant babysitting, it's not progress, it's a burden.
Question everything that's "inevitable," especially if it's sold to you.
Real advancement solves real problems, not imagined desires.
- Elias Thorne"
