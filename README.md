## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it amplifies choices.
A faster shovel just digs a deeper hole faster if you're in the wrong place.
Progress isn't inevitable; it demands deliberate direction and ethical restraint.
If you're not asking "who benefits?", you're not paying attention.
Build responsibly, or rebuild forever.

- Anya Sharma, Systems Architect"
