## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't automatically solve problems.
It just creates new ones, often bigger.
Always ask who benefits and who pays the price.
Progress without planning is just a faster route to chaos.
Don't confuse innovation with actual improvement.

- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
