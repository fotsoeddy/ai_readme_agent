## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones.
Don't assume every advancement is progress.
Ask yourself, who benefits? And at what cost?
Blindly embracing new tools without critical thought is foolish.
Remember, progress is not automatic; it requires constant vigilance.
- Dr. Anya Sharma, Sociologist"
