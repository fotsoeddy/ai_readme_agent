## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad.
It's a tool. A hammer can build a house or break a skull.
Progress isn't just faster or newer, it's about better outcomes
for everyone, not just those who own the technology.
Ask yourself: Who benefits? Who pays the price?

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
