## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands vigilance. Each new tool expands possibilities while simultaneously amplifying potential for misuse. Constant adaptation is not optional; it's the price of participation. Ignore the ethical implications at your peril; progress without responsibility is a loaded weapon. The future belongs to those who learn faster and adapt smarter.
- Evelyn Reed"
