## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency. It rarely delivers simplicity.
New tools require new skills, or they become expensive bricks.
Progress demands we adapt, or we'll be automated out.
Innovation isn't inherently good; its value lies in responsible use.
Don't confuse "can do" with "should do" â€“ ethics still matter.

- Elias Thorne"
