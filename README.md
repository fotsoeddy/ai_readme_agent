## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic. It's just tools.
Tools that can build or destroy, depending on who's holding them.
Faster doesn't always mean better. Think about the consequences.
Don't let the shiny new thing distract you from basic human needs.
Progress should improve life for everyone, not just some.

- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
