## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology amplifies what we already are.
If you're lazy, it lets you be lazier, faster.
If you're corrupt, it provides bigger platforms for deceit.
The tools themselves are neutral; the human using them is not.
Consider who benefits, and how, before celebrating progress.
- Grace Hopper (Alternate Reality)"
