## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but it demands constant attention.
Don't be fooled into thinking faster is always better.
Progress should solve problems, not create new ones to sell solutions for.
Before automating a task, understand why it's done that way in the first place.
Remember that behind every line of code, there's human impact, intended or not.
- Eleanor Vance"
