## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology amplifies what we already are.
It won't magically fix broken systems or ethics.
Progress isn't about faster clicks and wider screens,
but about improving the quality of life for everyone.
Be wary of trading real connection for virtual validation.
- Eleonora Vance"
