## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's purpose isn't just cleverness. It's not about what *can* be done, but what *should* be. Ask yourself: Does it truly improve lives? Does it solve real problems for the many, not just create new ones for a few? If not, it's just a shiny distraction. Let's focus on tangible benefits that serve everyone.

- Eleanor Vance"
