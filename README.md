## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It's a tool, like a hammer. You can build a house with it, or smash someone's skull.

The difference is intent. Are you using it to connect, to empower, to build a better future? Or are you using it for profit above all else, fueling division and short-sighted gains?

Don't blindly embrace every new gadget. Ask 'Who benefits?' and 'At what cost?' before jumping on the bandwagon.

The future isn't inevitable; it's built brick by brick by the choices we make today regarding how we use these technologies.

Our choices, not the tech itself, determine if progress is truly progressive."
- Eleanor Vance"
