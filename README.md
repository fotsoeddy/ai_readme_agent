## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't just shiny devices.
It's about solving real problems: hunger, disease, ignorance.
Progress isn't automatic; it requires hard work and smart application.
Don't get lost in the bells and whistles.
Focus on using technology to make life better for everyone.
- Eleanor Vance"
