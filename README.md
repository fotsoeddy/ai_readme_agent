## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote:

"New tools don't solve old problems on their own.
They magnify what we already are: efficient or wasteful,
connected or isolated. Progress isn't a default setting;
it's a choice. Use the tech to build, not just to distract.
Or you'll just be efficiently digging a deeper hole."
- Evelyn Reed"
