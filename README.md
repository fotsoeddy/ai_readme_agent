## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it reshapes them.
Faster doesn't always mean better; smarter usually does.
Progress isn't about inventing; it's about understanding the consequences.
Just because we can build it, doesn't mean we should.
The human factor is always the weakest link, no matter how advanced the tech.

- General Marius Valerius"
