## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should solve problems, not create new ones wrapped in shiny interfaces. Faster isn't always better if it means less reliable. Progress isn't about novelty; it's about lasting improvement in people's lives. Before you automate, optimize. And remember, the best tech is invisible tech â€“ the kind that just works.
- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
