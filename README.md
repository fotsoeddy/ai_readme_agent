## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a magic wand.
It amplifies what is already there, good or bad.
If your systems were broken before, they'll just be broken faster now.
Focus on solving real problems, not chasing shiny objects.
Progress demands responsibility, not just innovation."
- Eleanor Vance"
