## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it changes them. Be prepared to deal with the new problems it creates.
Don't assume newer is always better. Consider the long-term costs and the unexpected side effects.
Focus on what technology enables you to *do* for people, not just what it *can* do.
The most valuable skill isn't using the newest gadgets, it's understanding their limitations.
Progress should improve lives, not just generate profit. If it only benefits a few, it isn't progress at all.

- Evelyn Reed"
