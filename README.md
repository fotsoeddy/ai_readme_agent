## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't inherently solve problems.
It just reshapes them, often making them faster and more complex.
Think about the consequences before you deploy.
Progress isn't inevitable; it requires ethical considerations and continuous maintenance.
If it breaks, have a plan. Always have a plan.

- Elias Thorne"
