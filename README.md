## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems. That's its job.
But every solution breeds new problems, guaranteed.
Faster, easier, doesn't always mean better, remember that.
Don't get so caught up in the shiny, that you lose sight of real needs.
Ask yourself, who benefits, and at what cost?

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
