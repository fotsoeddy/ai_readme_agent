## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't just faster or newer. It's got to solve problems, not create more.
If it doesn't improve daily life for real people, then it's just a fancy toy.
Progress means making things accessible and reliable.
Build solutions that are practical and useful for the future.
Skip the hype; focus on delivering tangible value.

- Elias Thorne"
