## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it amplifies them.
Good intentions are never enough to justify unchecked progress.
Always ask: Who benefits? And who is harmed?
Innovation without ethics is a runaway train.
The future isn't inevitable; it's built by decisions we make today.
- Anya Sharma"
