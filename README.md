## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad.
It's a tool. Like a hammer, it can build or destroy.
The responsibility rests with the user, not the machine.
Ignore the potential for misuse and you're setting yourself up for problems.
Always ask, "What could go wrong?" before you build it.

- Evelyn Reed"
