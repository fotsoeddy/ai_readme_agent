## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s promise isn't just convenience.
Itâ€™s about making life fairer for everyone.
Think access to information, healthcare for all.
But that potential vanishes if profit dictates everything.
Progress means technology serving humanity, not the other way around.
- Anya Sharma"
