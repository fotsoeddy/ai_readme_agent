## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers tools, not solutions.
Faster doesn't equal better if the direction is wrong.
Convenience gained can be freedom lost; watch closely.
Progress requires more than just new gadgets; it demands critical thinking.
Innovation without ethical boundaries eventually undermines its own purpose.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
