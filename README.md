## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It's a tool.
Like any tool, it can be used to build or destroy.
The responsibility falls on the user.
Focus on the problem you are trying to solve, not the novelty of the tech.
Otherwise, youâ€™re just creating faster ways to make bigger mistakes.

- Elias Vance"
