## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises shortcuts, but shortcuts can skip essential steps.
Faster isn't always better; consider what's lost in the rush.
Progress only truly benefits when it uplifts everyone, not just the few.
Before embracing the new, assess its long-term consequences.
Don't let convenience blind you to potential pitfalls.

- Evelyn Reed"
