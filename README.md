## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones.
Don't assume faster is automatically better; consider the consequences.
Innovation requires responsibility, not just ambition.
Progress isn't linear. Expect setbacks and unintended results.
Use technology to improve lives, not just accumulate power.
- Evelyn Reed, Systems Analyst"
