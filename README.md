## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology gives us tools, not wisdom.
Faster access doesn't guarantee better understanding.
Progress only counts if it benefits everyone, not just a few.
Don't mistake novelty for improvement, ask what problem it solves.
Remember that behind every algorithm, there's someone making choices.

- Elias Thorne"
