## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but requires constant vigilance.
New tools solve old problems, and create entirely new ones that weren't even imaginable before.
Progress isn't automatically good; it depends on who benefits and at what cost.
Don't be so busy chasing the future that you neglect the present's needs and potential damage.
Real advancement considers the human impact, not just the speed or the convenience.

- Anya Sharma"
