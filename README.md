## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's leverage. It amplifies what you already are.
Bad intent with faster machines just makes bigger problems faster.
Progress isn't inevitable, it's a choice. A choice to use new tools wisely.
Don't get blinded by the shiny object. Focus on what you want to build.
Remember the human behind the interface, or everything breaks down.

- Eleanor Vance"
