## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should serve a purpose, not create one.
If it doesn't solve a real problem efficiently, it's just noise.
Focus on making tools that empower, not enslave.
Don't get distracted by the shiny new thing.
Ask yourself, "Does this actually improve lives?"

- Elias Vance"
