## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems. It also creates them.
The speed of innovation means continuous learning is not optional.
If you aren't upgrading your skills, you are falling behind.
Don't mistake new features for true progress if they don't fix real needs.
Focus on what technology *does* for people, not just what it *is*.
- Dr. Eleanor Vance"
