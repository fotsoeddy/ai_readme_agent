## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones.
Don't mistake novelty for true advancement.
Ask who benefits and at what cost.
Progress without ethics is just faster destruction.
And forgetting the lessons of the past guarantees repeating them, just with better gadgets.
- Evelyn Reed"
