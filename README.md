## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here is your quote:

Technology doesn't solve problems; it changes them. New tools create new failures. Efficiency gains demand constant vigilance for unintended consequences. Don't assume progress is inherently good, always ask who benefits and who pays. The future isn't automatic, it needs responsible direction.

- Evelyn Reed"
