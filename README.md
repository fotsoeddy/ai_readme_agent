## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote fitting your request:

Technology solves problems, but creates new ones.
It offers efficiency, but demands constant adaptation.
Progress isn't free; it has a cost in resources and jobs.
Don't blindly accept "new"; evaluate its true impact.
Innovation without ethics is a loaded weapon pointed at the future.

- Anya Sharma"
