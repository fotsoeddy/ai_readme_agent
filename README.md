## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't about building bigger, faster toys.

It's about using what we create to lift more people up.

Does this new tech solve a problem for everyday folks?

Or just create new ones dressed in a shiny wrapper?

If it doesn't improve lives, it's just expensive noise.

- Evelyn Reed"
