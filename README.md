## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it creates new ones.
Progress isn't always upward; sometimes it's just different.
Don't automate a bad process; you'll just make a bigger mess faster.
The latest gadget is only useful if it genuinely improves something.
Remember the human element; technology is a tool, not a replacement.
- Elias Thorne"
