## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote fitting your requirements:

Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant vigilance.
It solves old problems while creating new ones we haven't imagined.
Progress isn't a straight line; it's a tangled web of consequences.
Don't be blinded by the shiny surface; look at the underlying code.
Always ask: who benefits, and at what cost?

- Eleanor Vance"
