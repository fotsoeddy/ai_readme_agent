## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems, people using technology do.
Faster doesn't always mean better, consider the consequences.
Progress without ethics is just a faster path to disaster.
Innovation should improve lives, not just increase profits.
Don't confuse a shiny new gadget with actual advancement.

- Evelyn Reed"
