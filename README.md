## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's leverage.
Understand its purpose before adoption.
Progress comes from solving real problems, not inventing new ones.
Data alone offers no wisdom; human analysis is critical.
Future success will hinge on our ability to adapt, not just invent.
- Eleanor Vance"
