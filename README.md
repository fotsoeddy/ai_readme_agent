## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote:

"Technology isn't magic. It's a tool. A powerful one, sure, but still just a tool. It will amplify what you already are: efficient or lazy, connected or isolated. Focus on the operator, not the gadget, if you want real progress. Waste enough time chasing the shiny new object, and you'll be left behind."
- Evelyn Hayes"
