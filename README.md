## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's only as good as the problem it solves.
Fancy features don't matter if it's a pain to use.
Progress isn't about more, it's about better outcomes for real people.
Don't get blinded by the shiny new thing; ask what it actually *does*.
Sustainable development must be interwoven with all technological advances.
- Eleanor Vance"
