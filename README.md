## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology moves forward, whether we're ready or not.
It doesn't care about your comfort level or outdated skills.
Adapt, learn the new tools, or become obsolete.
Complaining about change is a waste of valuable time.
Focus on understanding and leveraging it; your future depends on it.
- General Marcus Thorne"
