## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but delivers complexity.
Every advancement creates a new set of problems to solve.
Remember that increased speed doesn't always equal progress.
Focus on how tools impact people, not just what they can do.
Before adopting anything new, ask if it truly makes life better.
- Elias Thorne"
