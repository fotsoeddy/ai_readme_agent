## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, it doesn't eliminate them.
Every advancement creates new challenges, different in nature.
Focus on adaptability and responsible implementation first.
Otherwise, you're just trading old messes for new ones.
Don't mistake speed for actual progress.

- Anya Sharma"
