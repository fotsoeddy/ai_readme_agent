## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't automatic improvement.
It's a tool, and tools amplify what's already there.
If you have good intentions, it can do great things.
If you have bad ones, it will do even worse things, faster.
Don't mistake technological advancement for moral advancement."
- Anya Sharma"
