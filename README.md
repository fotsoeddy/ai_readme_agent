## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't just about faster speeds or smaller gadgets.
Itâ€™s about solving actual problems, not creating new ones.
If your innovation requires a manual to explain the basic function,
Youâ€™ve likely missed the mark and added to the noise.
Focus on real needs, not hypothetical wants fueled by marketing.
- Elias Thorne"
