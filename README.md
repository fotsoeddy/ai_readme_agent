## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises to solve problems, but often creates new ones.
Don't blindly trust the "latest and greatest"; question its purpose.
Always consider the unintended consequences before widespread adoption.
Focus on solving real-world needs, not just inventing new gadgets.
Progress isn't automatic; it requires constant ethical evaluation.
- Elias Vance"
