## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's value isn't in what it *can* do, but what it *does* do for people.
If it complicates more than it simplifies, it's a problem, not progress.
Focus on solving real-world issues first; novelty can wait.
Remember to consider the unintended consequences alongside the benefits.
Ultimately, good technology empowers, it does not enslave.
- Dr. Aris Thorne"
