## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems, it shifts them.
Faster is not always better, especially if you break things.
Progress without purpose is just wasted energy.
Think about the consequences before you hit 'send' or 'launch'.
Ask yourself: who benefits, and who gets left behind?

- Elias Thorne"
