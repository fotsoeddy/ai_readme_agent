## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s promise isnâ€™t just speed or convenience.
Itâ€™s about removing barriers to opportunity.
If it widens the gap between the haves and have-nots,
then weâ€™re building a fancy wall, not a helpful bridge.
Progress should lift everyone, not just the already elevated.
- Eleanor Vance"
