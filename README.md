## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers solutions, not replacements.
Understand its limitations as well as its potential.
Faster doesn't always mean better; consider the impact.
Progress shouldn't erase the lessons of the past.
Implement strategically or risk creating new problems.

- Evelyn Reed"
