## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant vigilance.
New tools don't automatically build a better world; people do.
If the purpose isn't clear, the technology will define it for you, often poorly.
Progress isn't just faster; it must also be fairer and more sustainable.
Donâ€™t blindly trust algorithms. Understand who coded them, and why.

- Eleanor Vance"
