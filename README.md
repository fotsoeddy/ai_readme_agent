## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances whether we fully understand its consequences or not.
Ignoring the potential downsides in pursuit of progress is irresponsible.
Education on the ethical use of new tools must be a priority, not an afterthought.
Otherwise, we risk creating problems far bigger than the solutions we sought.
Remember, innovation without foresight is just reckless experimentation.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
