## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant vigilance. Implementing new systems without understanding existing workflows is a recipe for expensive failure. Remember that data is only as good as the people who interpret it. Progress isn't about having the newest tool; it's about using tools effectively to solve real problems. If it doesn't improve people's lives, it's just a shiny distraction.
- Anika Sharma"
