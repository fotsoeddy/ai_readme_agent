## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but demands diligence.
New tools amplify existing skills, not create them.
Faster processes require even stricter quality control.
Progress is a choice, not an inevitability, needing direction.
Ultimately, technology serves humanity, not the other way around.
- Eleanor Vance"
