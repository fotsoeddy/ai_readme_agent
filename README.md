## ğŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but rarely delivers simplicity. Each new tool creates new dependencies, often unseen until they break. Don't assume progress solves problems; it mostly reshapes them. Training and adaptation are continuous, not a one-time purchase. The biggest upgrade needed is often to human understanding.
- Elias Thorne"
