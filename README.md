## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, nothing more.
Its value is measured only by its usefulness to people.
Progress isn't inherent in a new device or system.
It is progress only if it solves real problems for more people.
Otherwise, it's just a distraction from the real work.
- Dr. Eleanor Vance"
