## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't about the newest gadget; it's about fixing the old problems in smarter ways. Technology should serve the people, not the other way around. If it creates more problems than it solves, it's not progress; it's just noise. Remember to ask "who benefits?" before blindly adopting the next big thing. Focus on accessibility and practicality, not just innovation for innovation's sake.

- Ava Sharma"
