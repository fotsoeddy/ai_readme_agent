## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances because someone needs it to, not because it's inherently good.
Remember that the tools we create shape us just as much as we shape them.
Progress without considering the consequences is just speeding in the wrong direction.
Focus on solving real problems for real people, not just chasing the next shiny thing.
The ethical considerations must always keep pace with the technical capabilities.
- Elias Thorne"
