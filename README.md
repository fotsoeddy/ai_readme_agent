## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems, people do.

It's a tool, like a hammer. You can build a house or break a window.

Faster isn't always better. Smarter application matters more.

Consider the cost, beyond the price tag. Look at the impact.

Before you automate, optimize. Fix the process first, then add the machine.

- General Elara Vasquez"
