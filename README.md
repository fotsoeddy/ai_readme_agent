## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't automatically solve problems. It amplifies what's already there.
If your processes are broken, faster computers just make them break faster.
Focus on fixing the fundamentals first; shiny new tools are useless otherwise.
Real progress comes from smart application, not just increased speed or capacity.
Don't let innovation be a distraction from actually getting things done.
- Elias Vance"
