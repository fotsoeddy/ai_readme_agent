## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology gives us power, but power without planning just makes bigger messes faster. Before you automate, understand what you're automating and *why*. Are you solving a problem, or just creating a new one down the line? Efficiency at the expense of human connection is a net loss, always. Remember, tools are meant to serve, not to dictate.
- Anya Sharma"
