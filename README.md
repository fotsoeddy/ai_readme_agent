## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't about the shiniest new thing.
It's about making life easier for more people.
Can this tech solve real problems, or just create new ones?
If it only helps a select few, itâ€™s not progress for all.
We need to measure its benefit against the cost to everyone.

- Eleanor Vance, Systems Analyst"
