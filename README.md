## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but delivers complexity.
The new tool is only helpful if people actually learn how to use it.
Progress isn't about more gadgets; it's about making lives better.
Consider the long-term consequences; every advantage has a cost.
Don't automate problems; fix them first.

- Alistair Grimm"
