## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a practical quote:

"Technology gives us the power to do incredible things, but it doesn't tell us *what* to do. The latest gadget is just a tool. Ethical choices, sound planning, and a focus on real problems are still required. Don't confuse shiny objects with actual progress, or we'll all end up polishing garbage. And for God's sake, update your passwords regularly.
- Ada Lovelace "
