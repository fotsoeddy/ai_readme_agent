## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's only good if it solves a real problem.
Fancy features don't matter if people can't use it.
Progress isn't just making things faster, it's making them better.
Remember to ask what we're actually trying to achieve.
Otherwise, we're just digging a deeper hole faster.
- Brenda Martinez"
