## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances whether we're ready or not.
Focus less on its potential utopia, more on its real-world impact.
Ask who benefits, who is left behind, and at what cost.
Uncritical adoption is a recipe for reinforcing existing inequalities.
Think hard about consequences, because code isnâ€™t neutral.

- Elias Thorne"
