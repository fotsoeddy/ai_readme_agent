## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should solve problems, not create new ones.
Efficiency is good, but not at the cost of human connection.
Always consider the long-term consequences of your inventions.
If something can be used for harm, assume it eventually will be.
Progress isn't about what *can* be done, but what *should* be done.

- Dr. Aris Thorne"
