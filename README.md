## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers efficiency, but efficiency alone is a hollow victory.
Itâ€™s a tool, not a compass.
Progress demands we ask: Does this improve lives, or merely complicate them?
Innovation without ethical consideration is a runaway train, no matter how fast.
Always question the cost of "advancement," because someone is always paying it.
- Elias Thorne"
