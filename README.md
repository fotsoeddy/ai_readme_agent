## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but often delivers complexity.
Remember that progress isn't just building faster; it's building better.
Focus on solving real problems, not just creating new gadgets.
If technology amplifies existing inequalities, it isn't progress at all.
Always ask yourself: does this truly make life easier for everyone, or just for a few?
- Dr. Eleanor Vance"
