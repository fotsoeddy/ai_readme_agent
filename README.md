## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promised efficiency; that's the sales pitch.
But efficiency doesn't automatically equal progress.
Progress requires intent. Who benefits? Who loses?
If your new tech just shuffles wealth upwards faster,
it's a more efficient problem, not a better world.

- Eleanor Vance"
