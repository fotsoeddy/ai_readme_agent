## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It's a tool, plain and simple.
It amplifies what's already there, the best and worst of us.
Focus on building solid ethics and judgment.
Otherwise, you're just giving a powerful weapon to an idiot, or worse.
Progress requires responsibility, not just innovation.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
