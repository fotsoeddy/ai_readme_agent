## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology changes everything, but not necessarily for the better immediately.
It amplifies existing strengths and weaknesses.
Remember that efficiency without ethical considerations is just speed towards a cliff.
Focus on solving real problems, not just creating novelties.
Sustainable progress considers long-term consequences, not just short-term gains.
- Anya Sharma"
