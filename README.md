## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency.
It rarely delivers it without demanding something in return:
Your time, your data, or even your autonomy.
Always ask what problem the technology *actually* solves,
And for whom. Don't be blinded by the next shiny object.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst."
