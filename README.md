## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's advance isn't automatically progress for humanity.
It needs to be aimed deliberately at solving tangible problems.
Ignoring potential downsides or societal impacts is foolish.
Always ask, "Who benefits?" and "Who carries the burden?"
Blind faith in innovation guarantees more problems than solutions.
- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
