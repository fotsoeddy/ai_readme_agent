## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones. Don't assume that every advancement is automatically good.
Understand the full consequences before you adopt new systems.
Real progress isn't just speed or efficiency; it's about improving lives equitably.
Consider who benefits, who is harmed, and what resources are consumed.
Blind faith in technology is a dangerous path to unintended outcomes.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
