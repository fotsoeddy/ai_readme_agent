## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it always creates new ones. Don't be blinded by the shiny object; consider the cost. Automation increases efficiency but demands workforce retraining. Access doesn't equal understanding; education is still key. Progress without ethics is just faster destruction.
- Elias Vance"
