## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but it demands responsibility.
Faster doesn't always mean better; consider the consequences.
Progress without purpose is just frantic activity.
Before automating a process, understand its core value.
Ultimately, tools amplify intentions, both good and bad.
- Evelyn Reed"
