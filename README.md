## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't inherently solve problems; it magnifies intent.

A poorly designed system implemented efficiently will still produce bad results, only faster.

Focus on understanding the core need before chasing the newest gadget.

Progress isn't just about what we *can* do, but what we *choose* to do.

Remember the human element; automation without empathy is just another form of control.

- Anya Sharma"
