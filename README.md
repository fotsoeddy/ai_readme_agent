## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's purpose isn't just speed.
It should solve real problems, not create new ones.
Consider the long-term costs, not just the short-term gains.
Does this innovation help more people than it hurts?
That's the question we need to keep asking ourselves.

- Elias Thorne"
