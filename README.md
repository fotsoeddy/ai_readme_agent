## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it amplifies them. A bad person with a smartphone is still a bad person, just now faster at being bad. Progress without ethical considerations is just accelerated destruction. We build bigger hammers, but we don't always know what to hit. Remember to ask *why* before you ask *how*.
- Elias Vance"
