## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't a magic wand. It's a tool.
Like any tool, it can build or destroy, depending on who's holding it.
Don't focus on the next shiny thing; focus on the problem you're trying to solve.
Progress isn't inevitable; it requires critical thinking and responsible implementation.
If you're not solving real problems, you're just making noise.

- Jane Doe"
