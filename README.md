## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, nothing more.
It amplifies what we already are, good or bad.
Don't expect it to solve human problems alone.
Focus on fixing ourselves first, then apply the leverage.
Otherwise, you'll just get faster, bigger messes.
- Eleanor Vance, Efficiency Consultant"
