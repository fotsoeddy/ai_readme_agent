## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic. It's just tools.
Good tools help you build, bad tools break things faster.
The real progress isn't in the tool itself, but in what it allows you to *do*.
If new technology solves problems, great. If it just makes new ones, rethink it.
Don't let the shiny distractions blind you to whether you're actually improving anything.

- Elias Thorne"
