## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's supposed to fix problems, not make new ones.
Just because we *can* build something, doesn't mean we *should*.
Progress without purpose is just organized chaos.
Consider the unintended consequences before you celebrate.
Remember, code is just a tool; humans decide how it's used.

- Evelyn Hayes"
