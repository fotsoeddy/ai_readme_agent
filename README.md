## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but efficiency demands adaptation.
New tools reshape skills, rendering some obsolete and creating others.
Progress isnâ€™t simply adopting the latest gadget; it's understanding its impact.
Consider the consequences alongside the convenience, or innovation becomes disruption.
Don't mistake constant change for actual advancement; value comes from improvement.
- Elias Thorne"
