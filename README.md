## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates them. Don't get distracted by the shiny new gadget. Ask yourself: does this actually *improve* people's lives, or just make someone money? Progress without ethical consideration is just another way to screw things up faster. Remember to look before you leap into the next update.

- Eleanor Vance"
