## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't about the shiniest gadget. It's about who benefits from it.
Does it actually make life better, or just more complicated?
Can everyone access the new tools, or only a select few?
Real advancement addresses real needs, not manufactured desires.
If technology widens the gap, we've failed.

- Evelyn Reed"
