## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, yes, but creates new ones alongside.
Faster isn't always better if it breaks what we value.
Progress should serve people, not the other way around.
Always ask who benefits and who pays the price.
Don't be blinded by shiny objects; build with purpose."
- Eleanor Vance"
