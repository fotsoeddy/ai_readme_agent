## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's just applied effort.
Faster, cheaper, more efficient - that's the goal.
But remember, efficiency without ethics is a disaster.
Don't chase progress blindly, ask "progress for whom?"
If it makes things worse for most, it's not progress at all.
- Amelia Stone, Systems Engineer"
