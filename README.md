## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's only valuable if it solves a real problem.
Faster isn't always better; think about what you're speeding up.
If it creates more problems than it fixes, ditch it.
Don't let the new gadgets distract you from the actual goal.
Progress should improve life for everyone, not just a few.
- Evelyn Reed"
