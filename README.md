## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here is a quote that meets your specifications:

Technology's not magic. It's a tool.
Like any tool, it can build or destroy.
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
Think about the consequences, not just the speed.
Use it to fix problems, not create new ones.
- Eleanor Vance"
