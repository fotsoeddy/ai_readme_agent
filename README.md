## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology improves, but it doesn't inherently solve problems.
It magnifies what already exists, good or bad.
Garbage in, garbage out is truer now than ever.
Focus on responsible development and usage, not just novelty.
Otherwise, progress just creates bigger, faster messes.
- Eleanor Vance"
